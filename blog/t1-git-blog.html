      Since that blog will be MY kitchen, I have decided to cook you a little something of myself today.
      After a two days "freak out" phase, it just clicked how cleaver the DBC program is.
      All the material we went through at the prequisit regarding Growth mindset, impostor syndrom, learning style, etc. It all makes sense now as i'm digging in P0. I am little by little applyng these technics to control my emotions and it works...


      A tres plus sur mon blog.

      I'm starting to take pleasure out of being  lost and fighting my way through. Having the "i got it moment". Looking @ the post on google+ and seeing everybody converging toward the same goal.
      Bref, I am learning to learn and so far I love it.
