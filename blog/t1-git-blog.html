        Git is a version control app that allows you to keep version/snapshot/commit of your work every time you are making a change and to branch out from the main and work on iterating a specific piece. By doing this you can always go back to a previous version if you make mistakes or if you feel that you went the wrong direction.
    </p>
        Github allows you to share this tool online in a cloud environment and therefore to work with several programmer on the same project but on different part of it all at the same time. The main interest of it is to be able to split and work at the same time on different part of the main project.
    <p>
        Eventually everything is merged and once can always go back to the previous version if not happy with the new one.

    <p>
        It s a very powerful collaborative tool and vastly used by the programmer community.
