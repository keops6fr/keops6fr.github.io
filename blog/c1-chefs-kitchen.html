      Since that blog will be MY kitchen, I have decided to cook you a little something from myself today.
      After a two days in "freak out" phase, it just clicked how cleaver the DBC program is.
      All the material we went through at the prequisit regarding Growth mindset, impostor syndrom, learning style, etc. It all makes sense now as i'm digging in P0. I am little by little applying these technics to control my emotions and it works...

      Looking @ the post on google+ and seeing everybody converging toward the same goal.
